  <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi. I am currently enrolled in a third semester of a multimedia design programme. The study combines coding and design practices for digital products.</p>

<p>I am excited to find my way in this industry and explore my personal interests. I am looking for an internship position that would allow me to try out different areas of digital product creation such as UX, design and development.
 </p>

 <div>
 <p>I believe in collaborative practices and inspiring teamwork. I am happy to take in knowledge and contribute mine. </p>

<p>I care deeply about open communication, thorough reasearch process, iterative design, creative problem-solving and attention to details and accessibility.</p>

<p>I work with modern front-end technologies. For my specialisation semster I chose a ‘Front-End Design’ elective where we dive deeper into the front-end tools.

Mastering these tools is a process in progress but I am excited and motivated to keep on learning.</p>
