      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am currently enrolled in a third semester of a multimedia design programme. The study is a 2-year long programme combining coding and design practices for digital products. I am excited to find my way in this industry and explore my personal interests. I am looking for an internship position that would allow me to try out different areas of digital product creation such as UX, design and development.</p>
      <p>I believe in collaborative practices and inspiring teamwork. I am happy to take in knowledge and contribute mine. I care deeply about open communication, thorough reasearch process, iterative design, creative problem-solving and attention to details and accessibility.</p>
      <h2>Tech stack</h2>
      <p>
        I work with modern front-end technologies. For my specialisation semster I chose a Front-End Design elective where we dive deeper into the front-end tools. Mastering these tools is a process in progress but I am excited and motivated to keep
        on learning.
